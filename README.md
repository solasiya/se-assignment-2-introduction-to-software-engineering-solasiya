Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
is a discipline whose goal is to produce high-quality software that meets specifications, is delivered on schedule, and stays under budget (Aggarwal, 2005). 
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
There is more to software engineering than just conventional programming. Software engineering is the process of creating programmes, documenting any aspect of programming, and setting up and running a software system (Aggarwal, 2005).
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Agile is basicaly build and fix model, this is straight to the point model, it is a simple two phase model. The first model is to write code and the next phase is to fix it.
Waterfall model has five phase: requirement alaysis and specification, design, implementation and unit testing, integration and system testing, and operation and maintenance.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile model is for continues projects that run as cycle eg.Instagram. Whereas Waterfall model is for projects with end goal.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
One lengthy document that is written in plain language and describes what the system will do without going into detail about how it will do it is the result of requirement engineering.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
The concept of modularity in software design refers to the division of a software system into discrete, independent parts, or modules, each of which contains a particular function or group of related functions. Because of their clearly specified interfaces, these modules can communicate with one another and be independently built, tested, and maintained (Sullivan et al., 2001).
Systems that are designed with modularity in mind are easier to scale, evolve, and maintain. Modularity improves software's clarity, resilience, and adaptability by disassembling large systems into manageable pieces. This enables software to gradually integrate new functionalities and adapt to changing requirements (Sullivan et al., 2001).

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit testing involves testing individual components or units of code, such as functions or methods, in isolation from the rest of the system. The goal is to verify that each unit performs as expected.
 Integration testing focuses on verifying the interactions between integrated units or components.
 It ensures that combined units work together as expected.
System testing involves testing the entire system as a whole to ensure it meets the specified requirements. This level of testing evaluates the system's compliance with its business requirements.
Acceptance testing is conducted to determine whether a system satisfies its acceptance criteria and to decide whether the system is ready for deployment. It is often the final testing phase before the system goes live.

In order to guarantee the software's dependability, quality, and operation, testing is essential during the development process. It lowers expenses, manages risks, and raises user pleasure. Version control systems are a crucial component of contemporary software development processes because they facilitate efficient cooperation, tracking, and management of code modifications.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Tools called version control systems (VCS) assist in tracking modifications to source code over time. Because they enable several developers to work on the same project without overwriting each other's work, they are crucial for collaborative software development.
Subversion (SVN): Supports atomic commits, branches, and tags.
Mercurial: Similar to Git but with a different approach to certain version control concepts.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Leading a software development project from start to finish requires the expertise of a software project manager (SPM). Planning, carrying out, and wrapping up projects is the responsibility of an SPM, who also makes sure they adhere to schedule, budget, and requirement compliance. The following are the main duties and difficulties that a project manager for software must overcome: Project Planning, Team Management, Risk Management, Budget management, Communication, Quality assurance, Monitoring and Reporting, and Project Closure (Braude & Bernstein, 2016)..
Challenges are: Scope Creep, Resource Management, Time Management, Risk Management, Communication Barriers, Quality Control and Stakeholder Management(Braude & Bernstein, 2016).
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintenance is the process of upgrading and updating software applications after they have been deployed in order to repair errors, improve performance, or adapt to a changing environment. It ensures that the programme continues to work properly and efficiently throughout time, adjusting to new requirements and technologies as needed (Braude & Bernstein, 2016).
Software maintenance is an essential component of the software lifecycle that ensures the long-term dependability, adaptability, and performance of software systems. Maintenance actions aim to extend the usable life of software by fixing flaws, adapting to new contexts, improving features, and preventing possible difficulties. In an ever-changing technical context, software's value and performance require regular and proactive maintenance (Van Vliet et al., 2008).

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Ethical considerations are important to the practice of software engineering. Software engineers may ensure their work is responsible, fair, and respectful of users' rights by adhering to established ethical standards, continually educating themselves on emerging concerns, preserving transparency, and adopting strong security measures. Ethical software development not only safeguards users and organisations, but also adds to the long-term prosperity and reputation of the engineering profession (Braude & Bernstein, 2016).
